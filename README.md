This is half an experiment and half a demonstration to show what it would take to get function composition support in Rust _properly_ (apart from the operator or whatever syntax sugar), as in without weird workarounds or "emulation" stuff.

Hint: Don't dare to try yet. There are too much unstable (heavy) features that need work or even implementation and type inference is too weak to make this ergonomic enough even in simple cases.
